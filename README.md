Hey! Here you can find the details of Smart Shop. If you want to learn more, you can read me.

You can visit [Smart Shop Here](https://smartshop-jm.herokuapp.com/)!

Also, if you want to play with the responsiveness, you can use the developer tools to view the media queries.

# Tools that helped me

Smart Shop uses a few interesting technologies. Learn more about them below!

## Back-end technology

### MongoDB

MongoDB is a document database built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds who are building scalable applications using agile methodologies.

### MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas was used to deploy and scale a MongoDB cluster of all Smart Shop’s products in the cloud. MongoDB Atlas is easy to use and it has a free tier for projects such as this one!

### Mongoose.js

Smart Shops data schemas were created using the Mongoose ODM. The main advantage is an abstraction over pure mongo. Which makes it easier to transition from SQL databases to dynamic collections that have no structure defined.

### Express.js

Express.js is a modular web framework for Node.js. It is used for the easier creation of web applications and services. Express.js simplifies development and makes it easier to write secure, modular, and fast applications.

For example, Smart Shop uses Express.js to set up its product retrieval routes.

### Node.js

Node.js is used to execute all of the server-side code in Smart Shop.

## Front-end technology

### React

The client-side portion of the Smart Shop consists of several different technologies. React holds it all together.

React is an open-source library used for handling the view layer and can be used for the development of both web and mobile applications. Along with React, the front-end is composed of several other technologies!

### React-router-dom

React Router is a standard library system built on top of React and used to create routing in a React application. It provides the synchronous URL on the browser with data that will be displayed on the web page. It maintains the standard structure and behavior of the application and is mainly used for developing single-page web applications.

### Axios

Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser

Smart Shop uses Axios to make calls to the routes created using Express.js to pull data from the database that is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

### Redux and Redux-thunk

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing the application state.

With the help of Redux and Redux-thunk Smart Shop was able to simplify its state management and reduce the amount of client-side code. Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree. Smart Shop uses Redux-thunk to make asynchronous calls to the database when pulling information about the products.

## Visuals

Smart Shop was designed to look similar to the [Atom](https://atom.io/) website!

The visual material on your website is crucial to keeping your visitors engaged. As a result, it is critical to developing a clear message.

### Color Hunt

Founded by Gal Shir, Color Hunt is an open collection of color palettes. This tool serves thousands of color schemes for many different design and art purposes. If you’re struggling with color ideas and all your projects are looking monotonous check this tool out!

Note: The Color Hunt tool can be added as a Chrome Extension called Color Tab.

## Deployment

Deploying a website doesn’t need to be difficult or cost money.

Check out what I used to deploy this project!

### Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. The platform also has great Documentation per programming languages and it can be completely free!

Heroku Node.js docs can be found [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)!
